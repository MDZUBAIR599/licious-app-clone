End Notes ðŸ“‘

In this project I was tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and I have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.

Limitations
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
